Based on the information provided below is a report of analysis and conclusions

In this dataset, which includes 15 schools and a total of 39,170 students, the average maths score is higher (70.33) than the average reading score (69.98). The passing rate for maths(86.07) is also higher than for reading (84.42%), resulting in an overall passing rate of 72.80%. These results suggest that students generally perform better in maths than in reading.

. Referring to the table showing Scores by School Spending, schools that allocate a lower budget per student appear to have better performance compared to those that spend more.

. According to the Scores by School Size table, there is a noticeable variation in school performance between schools with a number of students of less than 2,000 and those with over 2,000. It appears that larger schools tend to have lower performance.
