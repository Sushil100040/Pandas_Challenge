Referring to the table showing Scores by School Spending, schools that allocate a lower budget per student appear to have better performance compared to those that spend more.

According to the Scores by School Size table, there is a noticeable variation in school performance between schools with a number of students of less than 2,000 and those with over 2,000. It appears that larger schools tend to have lower performance.
